// This file is intentionally blank.
// It's used to satisfy TypeScript when 'lucide-react' is imported
// but not all icons are explicitly used, preventing build errors
// related to tree-shaking or module resolution in some stricter setups.
// You generally do not need to modify this file.

// If you encounter issues with specific icons not being found and you are sure
// they exist in lucide-react, you might consider adding explicit type
// declarations here, though it's rarely necessary.
// Example:
// declare module 'lucide-react' {
//   export const YourSpecificIconName: (props: import('lucide-react').LucideProps) => JSX.Element;
// }
